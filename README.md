# Space Pong
## Description
This is my take on the classic game of pong made for a second semester Java class for a final project made with the Java library, no third party libarires. This game is a simple single player variation of pong, no multiplayer included. 
## Project features
* Aesthetically pleasing visuals
* Music/Sound effects
* Single Player
